<li>Where it is given</li>
<li>When effect is on/off (don't have to think about this yet)</li>
<li>Why it is right for the patient</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="using-ai">Using AI</h4>
<p>You can use AI (LLMs) like you would Wikipedia - not a reliable source but can be a good place to start. Need to verify what is said using quality resources.</p>

<li>P: Female patient 40-49 (match with what we can find in clinical literature). May change based on patient/family history</li>
<li>I: Screening mammogram</li>

<h4 id="what-does-a-doctor-do">What does a doctor do?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Many contexts of care each with different knowledge, skills, thinking and decisions that vary patient to patient</li>
<li>First thing to understand is what is this encounter about - <em>&quot;What brings you in today?&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Ex. Healthy man goes into ED with 2 days of worsening abdominal pain: Need to make diagnosis --&gt; informs management plan</li>
<li>Ex. Diabetes returns to PC for follow-up on diabetes: Managing chronic condition - understand history and current state and work to mitigate risks and complications using evidence within boudaries of unique patient boundaries</li>
<li>Ex. Teen broke leg: Fracture needs to be fixed</li>
<li>Ex. New metastatic colon cancer diagnosis: educate and guide patient in selecting amoung options based on individual</li>
<li>Ex. Healthy patient in for checkup: Build/maintain relationship to discuss heath concerns, questions, goals, and prevent future disease</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4 id="clinical-tasks">Clinical Tasks</h4>
<ol>
<li>Take history</li>
<li>Take physicals</li>
<li>Gather &quot;collateral history&quot;: EMR, family, etc.</li>
<li>Request and interpret diagnosistic tests</li>
<li>Take stock of all available info to ID problems/diagnoses</li>
<li>Consult with other clinicians</li>
<li>Consult literature for understanding and optimal management</li>
<li>Educate, counsel, and advise patient and family about their health</li>
<li>Prescribe meds, apply procedures</li>
<li>Document encounters</li>
</ol>
<p>In any given encounter, we do subset of above.</p>
<h4 id="encounter-with-new-symptom-diagnosis">Encounter with new symptom --&gt; diagnosis</h4>
<p>Diagnosis is central: ID of nature/cause of phenomenon. Patients want to know what is wrong and diagnosis informs treatment and prognisis.  <strong>Differential Diagnosis</strong> refers to multiple possible diagnoses to explain problem. <strong>Working Diagnosis</strong> is likley diagnosis that is acted upon while we may not be 100% sure.</p>
<p>Diagnoses are made by matching illness characteristics with &quot;illness scripts&quot;. Diagnoses can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Singular, well-defined disease (Heart failure due to genetic dialated cardiomyopathy)</li>
<li>Broad and heterogeneous category of diseases (Heart failure)</li>
<li>Somewhere inbetween</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proximate Diagnosis</strong> is a diagnosis that serves as an intermediary label... we want to arrive at an <strong>endpoint diagnosis</strong> that informs us what exactly is causing the problem and how to treat it.</p>
<h4 id="history-of-present-illness">History of present illness</h4>
<p>&quot;What brings you in today&quot; establishes chief concern - narrows worlds of possibility. More broadly, the clinical history is the most important category of info for diagnosis, sufficient for diagnosis in &gt;80% of cases is some contexts. Always will guide subsequent evaluation and leads to hypotheses.</p>
<p><strong>Chief concern / reason for visit: headache</strong></p>
<p>History of present illness: Dev is a 31-year-old woman with no past medical history who comes to urgent care with 3 days of headache.
She was in her usual state of health until 10 days ago, when she developed a urinary tract infection. She had some burning with urination. She took trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 3 days and her symptoms resolved quickly.
The headache started right as she was finishing the antibiotics. The pain started gradually while she was relaxing at home after work. She gets mild headaches sometimes, and she didn’t think much of it at the time. But the next day it was still there, and in fact it has remained constant and continued to get worse for the last two days.
The pain is all over her head, feels like a heaviness, and extends/radiates to her neck. It has gotten as bad as 8/10 in severity but improves to 5/10 when she takes ibuprofen, which she has done 2-3 times per day since it started. She hasn’t noticed anything else that makes it better or worse, except maybe that lying still helps and moving around and moving her neck makes it hurt more.
She had had no other associated symptoms until today, when she noticed she had no appetite and a little nausea. She has also noticed that she is bothered by bright lights.</p>
<p>She has not had any fevers, chills, or respiratory symptoms. She did not have any preceding trauma, unusual exposures, or substance use.</p>
<p>She is concerned about this headache both because of the severity of symptoms, which are interfering with her normal functioning, and because it feels very different from her normal occasional headaches. She looked up ”trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole headaches” and wonders whether she has aseptic meningitis.</p>
<p>A patient history should be :a complete, clear, and chronologic description of the problems prompting the patient’s visit” and “should reveal the patient’s responses to his or her symptoms and what effect the illness has had on the patient’s life”</p>
<h4 id="introductions">Introductions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wash hands, introduce yourself &quot;Hi, my name is ... working with ... Is it ok if we talk while we are waiting?&quot; ... &quot;who's with you today, is it ok if they stay while we talk.&quot;</li>
<li>What brings you in today... I heard x... I want to hear the story of what's been going on... Tell me more, what else...</li>
<li>Follow up with detailed questions on specific symptoms/exposures, get Y/N to the pertinent positives and negatives</li>
</ul>
<p>Chronological story of a symptom history</p>
<ol>
<li>Onset and timing</li>
<li>Location and radiation</li>
<li>Character and severity</li>
<li>Aggravating and alleviating factors</li>
<li>Symptoms associated</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;OLDCARTSS&quot; see slide 48</p>
<p><strong>Always get patient perspective</strong>: What do you think might be going on, what are you worried about, what were you hoping for/expecting to come out of this visit?</p>
