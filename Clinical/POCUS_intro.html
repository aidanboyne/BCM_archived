    <h4 id="components-of-ultrasound">Components of Ultrasound</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Transducer: source of sound (ultrasound probe).</li>
      <li>Compression and rarefaction: bunching and spreading of molecules in sound wave. One cycle consists of a compression and rarefaction.</li>
      <li>Sound is a longitudinal wave</li>
      <li>Frequency: cycles per second (Hz)
<ul><li>Infrasonic (&lt;20Hz)</li><li>Audible (20-20k Hz)</li><li>Ultrasonic (&gt;20k Hz): most cardiac probes between 2-10MHz</li></ul></li>
      <li>Period: time per cycle = 1/Frequency</li>
      <li>Propogation speed: average in tissue is 1540m/s. Varies with density and stiffness</li>
      <li>Wavelength: distance between 2 peaks or 2 valleys in cycle. Defined as speed/frequency</li>
      <li>Echogenicity: brightness on ultrasound (how sound-reflective structure is)
<ul><li>Hypoechoic = less bright than other structure</li><li>Hyperechoic = brighter than other structure</li><li>Isoechoic = same</li><li>Anechoic = no internal signal</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="principles-and-mechanism">Principles and Mechanism</h4>
    <p>Shorter wavelength = better resolution. However shorter wavelengths do not penetrate deeply. Thus shallow structures (veins, arteries) will be visualized with high-frequency, short wavelength probes. Deep structures will use lower frequency probes.</p>
    <p>Probes use piezoelectric elements to convert electricity to vibration which is transmitted via gel (which reduces impedance and improves skin contact) into tissue and reflected back based on:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Density</li>
      <li>Distance</li>
      <li>Scattering</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Reflections are then converted back to signal sent to the computer.</p>
    <p>Three assumptions are made:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sound travels in straight line</li>
      <li>Average speed is 1540m/s</li>
      <li>Depth is determined by time from transducer to return</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="probe-choice">Probe Choice</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Curved array: deep structures, abdomen, and pelvis.</li>
      <li>Linear array: superficial venous/arterial. Lung and neck scanning.</li>
      <li>Phased array: cardiac scanning (fits between ribs)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When scanning, stabilize your arm and hold probe like a pencil. The probe marker will correspond with a screen marker to indicate orientation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Indicator to head = slices along sagittal plane</li>
      <li>Indicator to right side = slices along transverse plane</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h4>
    <p>Organs with singal tissue type are more homogenous than organs with multiple tissue types. Fluid filled organs (bladder/gallbladder/heart chambers) are often anechoic.</p>
    <p>Artifacts</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverberation: repeating, equidistant parallel lines in lung, needles, breast implants, and some foreign objects.</li>
      <li>Posterior shadow: strong reflectors such as bone, metal, and calcifications</li>
      <li>Posterior Enhancement: bright area behind weak attenuator (i.e. bladder). Due to sound travelling relativley lossless through fluid.</li>
      <li>Mirror image: posterior to strong reflector due to indirect echo path. Common at diaphragm</li>
    </ul>
